# Calculator

This basic JavaScript Calculator was developed by me as part of my studies in [DEVinHouse](https://github.com/gbeserra95/DEVinHouse).
In this project, I tried to better organize my code by using modules.

As I improve my skills, I will be commiting new features and coding best practices.

You can access and test the app heading to https://gbeserra95.github.io/calculator/index.html

## Usage

***The calculator does not accept keyboard inputs and all texts are in Portuguese.***
